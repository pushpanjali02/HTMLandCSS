                <p="id1">The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

            The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
            
            Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
            
            Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

                <h1>CSS SELECTORS</h1>
                <p>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

            We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
            
            Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
            Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
            Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
            Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
            Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
